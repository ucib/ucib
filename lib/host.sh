# Ensure that a program is available.
#
# In order to be able to successfully build an image, many programs must be available.
# On a random user's system, there's no guarantee that all of those programs will
# be available already.  So, we need to do a few things:
#
# 1. Try and work out if the program *is* available already (ie it's
#    installed on the system);
#
# 2. Whether that program will do what we need it to (namespace collisions
#    and out-of-date versions are a PITA);
#
# 3. Work out where we might get the tool from if it isn't already there; and
#
# 4. Try and install it if necessary.
#
# This function tries to do all of those things.  So it needs a fair amount
# of information.
#
# Usage:
#
#    check_program_available <testcmd> <filename> <autoinstall>
#
# The function will execute `<testcmd>`, and if that returns true (0), the
# command will be deemed "available" and we'll return successfully.  If
# `<testcmd>` returns false, then we'll count it as "not available".  All
# output from `<testcmd>` will be redirected to /dev/null.  Feel free to
# have your `<testcmd>` try to run the program with `--help` and grep for
# needed options, etc if necessary.
#
# If the program is deemed to be "not available", then this function will
# call `install_program_in_host` if `<autoinstall>` is `y` (the default).
# Since `install_program_in_host` by default simply aborts the build and
# asks the user to install the software necessary by hand, host OS plugins
# should override this function to provide a more intelligent way of
# automatically installing the necessary software (such as searching for the
# package that contains the program and installing it).  The `<filename>`
# parameter will be useful in this effort, as it is the typical name of the
# program on the system.
